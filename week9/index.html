    <h1>The Window Object</h1>
    <p>
      In a browser environment, the global object is the "window" object, which
      represents teh browser window that contains a web page.
    </p>
    <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Note that the Browser Object Model only makes sense in a browswer
        environment. This means that other environments (such as Node.js)
        probably won't have a "window" object, although they will still have a
        global object.
      </li>
      <li>
        Global variables are actual properties of a global object. This means
        that any global variable created (variables created without the const,
        let or var keywords) are a property of the global object, "window" in
        this case.
      </li>
      <li>Global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program.</li>
      <li>
        Functions such as "parseInt() and isNaN()" are methods of the global
        object, which in a browser environment makes them methods of the
        "window" object.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is customary to omit accesssing them throught the "window" object,
        meaning instead of "window.parseInt(4.2)" you can just use
        "parseInt(4.2)".
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Dialogs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "alert()", "confirm()", and "prompt()" are supported by major browsers
        as methods of the "window" object.
      </li>
      <li>
        The "window.alert()" method always pauses the execution of the program
        and display a message in a dialog box. The message is Provided as an
        argument to the method and "undefined" is always returned.
        <code>window.alert('Hello');</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        The "window.confirm()" method stops the execution of the program and
        display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an
        argument, and giving the options of "OK" or "Cancel". It returns the
        boolean values of "true" if the user clicks "OK", and "false" if the
        user clicks "Cancel".
      </li>
      <li>
        The "prompt()" method stops the execution of the program, then displays
        a dialog that shows a message provided as an argument, as well as an
        input field that allows the user to enter text. The text is returned as
        a string when the user clicks 'OK'. If the user clicks 'Cancel', null is
        returned.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is important to note that these three methods all stop the program
        execution. This could cause issues if something has to be processed at
        the same time, or if the program is waiting for a callback function. Use
        sparingly.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Location</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The "window.location()" property is an object that contains information
        about the URL of the current page. It contains a number of properties
        that provide information about different fragments of the URL.
        <ul>
          <li>
            window.location.href: The href property returns the full URL as a
            string. This property is a read/write property, meaning it can also
            be changed by assignment.
          </li>
          <li>
            window.location.protocol: The "protocol" property returns a string
            describing the protocol used (such as "http", "https", "pop2",
            "ftp", etc). There is a colon at the end of the string output.
          </li>
          <li>
            window.location.host: The "host" property returns a string
            describing the domain of the current URL and the port number, which
            is often omitted if the default port 80 is used.
          </li>
          <li>
            window.location.hostname: The "hostname" property returns a string
            describing the domain of the current URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            window.location.port: The "port" property returns a string
            describing the port number, although it will return an empty string
            if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            window.location.pathname: The "pathname" property returns a string
            of the path that follows the domain
          </li>
          <li>
            window.location.search: The "search" property returns a string that
            starts with a "?" followed by the query string parameters. It
            returns an empty string if there are no query string parameters.
          </li>
          <li>
            window.location.hash: The "hash" property returns a string that
            starts with a "#" followed by the fragment identifier. It returns an
            empty strin if there is no fragment identifier.
          </li>
          <li>
            window.location.origin: The "origin" property returns a string that
            shows the protocol and domain where the curent page originated from.
            This property is read-only.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Controller Windows</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A new window can be opened using the "window.open()" method. This takes
        the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window
        title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third
        parameter. This can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can
        then be referenced later in the code.
      </li>
      <li>
        The "window.close()" method can be used to close a window, assuming you
        have a reference to it.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can also move a window using the "window.moveTo()" method. This
        takes two parameters that are the X and Y coordinates of the screen that
        the window is to be moved to.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can also resize a window using the "window.resizeTo()" method. Two
        parameters specify the width and height of the resized window's
        dimensions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Screen Information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The "window.screen" object contains information about the screen the
        browser is displayed on. You can find out the height and width of the
        screen in pixels using the "height" and "width" properties respectively.
        (<code>window.screen.height / window.screen.width)</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Timing Functions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        setTimeout(): The "window" object provides some useful methods for
        scheduling the execution of a function, and for repeatedly executing
        functions at regular intervals.
      </li>
      <li>
        The "window.setTimeout()" method acepts a callback to a function as its
        first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter.
        <code>window.setTimeout(() => alert("Time's Up!"), 3000)</code>. This
        code shows an alert dialog after three seconds ( 3000 milliseconds ).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>
    <h2>Errors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        System error - usually an issue with the system causing programs to
        crash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Programmer error - syntax errors or faulty program logic can cause
        errors.
      </li>
      <li>User error - incorrect data input can also cause issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exceptions</h2>
    <p>
      An exception is an error that produces a return value. This return value
      can be used to deal with the error.
    </p>

    <h2>Stack Traces</h2>
    <p>
      A stack trace is produced by an exception. This shows you where the error
      occurred, and you can work your way backwards to solve the problem.
    </p>

    <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
    <p>
      To avoid sloppy code, ES5 introduced strict mode, that produces more
      exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.
      Strict mode simply requires the string '<code>use strict</code>' at the
      first line of a JS file. You can also use strict mode on a per-function
      basis.
    </p>

    <h2>Feature Detection</h2>
    <p>
      We can determine a browsers support for a certain feature by using feature
      detection. You can wrap any methods you are uncertain about in an if block
      thus:<br />
      <code> if (window.holoDeck) { virtualReality.activate(); } </code><br />
      Another cool library that helps to implement feature detection is
      <b>Modernizr</b>
    </p>

    <h2>Debugging in the Browser</h2>
    <p>
      In the past, alerts were used for debugging, but modern JavaScript came up
      with the console.log() method. This can be used to log the value of
      variables at different stages of the program. Also, console.trace() will
      log an interactive stack trace in the console. This will show the
      functions that were called in the lead up to an exception occurring while
      the code is running.
    </p>

    <h2>Execption Handling</h2>
    <p>
      If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it
      in a try block. The code inside the try block will run as normal, but if
      there is an exception thrown, an error object is automatically passed as a
      parameter to the catch block.

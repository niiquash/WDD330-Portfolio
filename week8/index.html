    <h1>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</h1>
    <h2>Transforms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The transform property allows you to translate, rotate, scale or skew
        any element on the page
      </li>
      <li>
        An elements appearance can be manipulated using transform functions,
        separated by spaces and applied in the order they're provided.
      </li>
      <h3>Translation</h3>
      <li>
        Translation: translation functions allow you to move an element left,
        right, up or down, similar to the behavior of position: relative;
      </li>
      <li>
        The "translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left and y from
        the top."
      </li>
      <li>
        Transforms require vendor prefixing for older browsers, including: IE9,
        Android up to 4.4.3, iOS8, and Blackberry 10.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can also use "translateX()" or "translateY()" if you want to move an
        element only vertically or horizontally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Note that transforms don't work on inline elements. A quick fix for this
        is to display the element as "inline-block".
      </li>
      <h3>Scaling</h3>
      <li>
        The function "scale(x,y)" scales an element by the defined factors
        horizontally and then vertically
      </li>
      <li>
        If only one value is provided, it will apply both vertically and
        horizontally to the element.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can also use "scaleX()" and "scaleY()" for individual scaling.
      </li>
      <h3>Rotation</h3>
      <li>
        The "rotate()" function rotates and element around the point of origin,
        usually the center of the element. Angles are specified, and positive
        angles go clockwise, while negative angles go counterclockwise.
      </li>
      <h3>Skew</h3>
      <li>
        The "skew(x,y)" function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. If the
        second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Transitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        This is a way of animating transforms to making them gradual instead of
        immediate. Our pages feel more dynamic with transitions. To create a
        simple transition using only CSS, follow these steps:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Declare the original state of the element in the default style
          declaration
        </li>
        <li>
          Declare the final state of your transition element; for example, a
          :hover state.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include the transition functions in your default style declarations
          using the transition properties: "transition-property",
          "transition-duration", "transition-timing-function",
          "transition-delay".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>transition-property</h3>
      <li>
        Any property changing from one value to another for which a valid
        midpoint can be found, can be transitioned.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can provide any number of CSS properties to the
        "transition-property" declaration, separated by commas. You can also use
        the keyword "all" to indicate that every supported property should be
        animated as it transitions.
      </li>
      <h3>transition-duration</h3>
      <li>This sets how long the transition will take.</li>
      <li>
        0.2 seconds is generally considered the optimum time for a transition.
        Anything slower will make the website seem slow, and anything faster may
        be too subtle.
      </li>
      <h3>transition-timing-function</h3>
      <li>
        This lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular
        detail.
      </li>
      <li>
        The common key terms for timing functions include "ease", "linear",
        "ease-in", "ease-out" or "ease-in-out".
      </li>
      <h3>transition-delay</h3>
      <li>
        This makes it possible to introduce a delay before the transition
        begins. This is good practice for a good UI experience.
      </li>
      <h3>transition shorthand</h3>
      <li>
        We can combine all four transition properties into one line:
        "transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms"
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>JavaScript Grammar</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>JS syntax is know as C-style because each statement ends with a new line of semicolon.</li>
        <li>Code blocks are placed in curly braces.</li>
        <li>There are quite a number of reserved words. Even though 'undefined', 'Nan', and 'Infinity' are not reserved, they should be treated as such.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Primitive Data Types</h2>
    <p>This is a list of primitive data types in JavaScript. Any value that is not included in the list is an <strong>object</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>String - "Hello"</li>
        <li>Symbol - "const uniqueID = Symbol();"</li>
        <li>Number - 157</li>
        <li>Boolean - true/false</li>
        <li>Undefined - undefined</li>
        <li>Null - null</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In JS, you can verify the type of value by using the <i>typeof</i> operator.</p>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p><i>const</i> and <i>let</i> are keywords used to declare variables. Const is used to declare immutable variables of primitive data types,
    while let is used to declare mutable variables. That said, if the variable holds an array, function or object, const will not make it immutable. 
    Meaning that the object can still be mutated. What const does not allow, however, is for the variable to be assigned to another object, array, or function.</p>
    <p>"let" and "const" have block scope, meaning that their values are only accessible within the block they are declared. It is generally bad practice to
        declare globally scoped variables in programming, as this can cause issues with reusing the same variable names in large programs, and having values overwrite
        each other.
    </p>

    <h2>Variable Naming</h2>
    <p>Constants and variable names can start with an upper/lower-case letter, underscore"_", or dollar sign "$". They can contain numbers, but cannot
        start with numbers. Examples: "$name", "_answer", "firstName", "address_line1".
    </p>

    <h2>String Properties and Methods</h2>
    <p>String variables have both properties and methods. The similarity between properties and methods is their use of the dot notation.
        An example of string property is the ".length" as in "name.length" property. An example of a method is ".toUpperCase()" as in "name.toUpperCase()".
        Methods contain parentheses, while properties do not.
    </p>

    <h2>Verifying if a Value is a Number</h2>
    <p>You can check if a value is a number than can be used by using the <i>Number.isInfinite()</i> methods
    If the return value is "true" it means the number is not "Infinity", "-Infinity", or "Nan".</p>

    <h2>Converting Between Strings and Numbers</h2>
    <p>There are a number of ways to change a string to a number</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Number('23'); >> 23</li>
        <li>const answer = '5' * 1; >> 5</li>
        <li>const answer = +'5'; >> 5</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Converting Numbers to Strings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>String(3); >> '3'</li>
        <li>3 + ''; >> '3'</li>
        <li>10..toString(); >> '10'</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Arrays</h2>
    <p>Using the delete keyword to remove items from an array can leave "undefined" holes in your array.
        The "length" property as in "array.length" is mutable. As you make the array longer, extra slots in the array
        will be filled with "undefined", and making the array shorter will completely remove all the extra elements in the array.
    </p>

    <h3>Useful Array Methods</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>pop(): remove and return element from end of array</li>
        <li>push(): add element to the end of array</li>
        <li>shift(): remove and return element from start of array</li>
        <li>unshift(): add element to the start of array</li>
        <li>slice(): creates a subarray from original array. It is non-destructive.</li>
        <li>splice(): used to remove and/or replace items in the list. It is a better option than "delete"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To find out if a certain value is in an array, use the "indexOf()" or "includes()" method.</p>

    <h2>Maps</h2>
    <p>Maps are used to create objects with key, value pairs. Useful methods when using maps are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>set(): add an item to the map</li>
        <li>get(): retrieve an item from the map</li>
        <li>delete(): remove an item from the map</li>
        <li>has(): check if an item exists in the map</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Default parameter should always come after non-default parameters in a function declaration. Example: function discount(price, amount=10) {}. This is to avoid having to enter default values anyway during function calls.</li>
        <li>Use a callback function to sort an array of integers. numbers.sort((a,b) => {return a-b})</li>
    </ul>

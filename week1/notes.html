    <h1>Week 1 Reading Notes</h1>
    <h2>Mobile UX Videos</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Designing for smallest first leads to beautiful and powerful designs</li>
        <li>PCs are replaced every 4-5 years. Mobile phone are replaced every 1-2 years</li>
        <li>More mobile traffic online has been recorded. Hence, build mobile first.</li>
        <li>Responsive is not equal to a mobile first design.</li>
        <li>Start small and scale up.</li>
        <li>Mobile is not a fad. We’re not getting rid of mobile devices anytime soon.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mobile Design Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Be there for the user. Help then through their journey </li>
        <li>Be useful. Provide users with what they came for.</li>
        <li>Be quick. Reduce their cognitive load. Make your interactions smooth and seamless. Example take a 5 steps
            task and make it 0 steps.</li>
        <li>Speed matters. Reduce image usage throughout sites. If images are used, use svg/ webfonts which have smaller
            bandwidth. Optimize and minify CSS and JS files. GZip files to eliminate unnecessary data.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Primary Controls</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Placement matters. Address reachability issues. It creates a perception of speed.</li>
        <li>Understanding matters. Example the hamburger menu icon is confusing to most who don’t understand the
            function of the icon.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ditch form labels and have them display inside the field instead.</li>
        <li>Float labels makes it a whole lot easier for users to fill out forms.</li>
        <li>Enable autocomplete on forms.</li>
        <li>Show password first then give users the option to hide passwords.</li>
        <li>When asking for numbers, ensure the number pad is displayed on mobile </li>
        <li>Make it easy for users to call your number with a single tap.</li>
    </ul>
